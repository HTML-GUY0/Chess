# Special
- All of the chess rules are made only with one JavaScript file.
- The AI is made also in the same file (script.js).
- The board is Clean and looks same as Chess.com's board.
- There's no errors :)

# Problems
- You can't promote to any other pieces more than a queen so not every single move is possible.

- The AI can't checkmate, it doesn't knows how to checkmate. It starts playing some random moves when you don't have any pieces left, so just accept it as a lost game (not of the ai) because it cannot even blunder anything or just resign.
